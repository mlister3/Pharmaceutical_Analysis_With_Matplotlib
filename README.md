# Pharmaceutical_Analysis_With_Matplotlib

### Use Matplotlib module to visualize trial data and perfrom analysis.

## Background
> You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
